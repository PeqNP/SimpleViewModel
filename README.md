# SimpleViewModel

A simple, robust, view model pattern.

- No "infinite sink" when debugging (e.g. `RxSwift`). Know where a signal originates from.
- Easily pass-thru child signals to parent view models. No complicated wiring. Use delegation, a pattern that has been used for decades.
- Dependency injection
- Easy to change
- Easy to test

## Introduction

This view model pattern builds on top of tried and true patterns that have been around for decades. It doesn't try to be "smart", just functional.

**Examples will be added soon**
