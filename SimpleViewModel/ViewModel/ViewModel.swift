     Returns a callback that can be used for async responses which are not directly related to an input. For example, a view model may listen to the user's signed in status. If a user signs in our out, the view model may want to send commands to the consumer informing them of the state change.

     NOTES:
     - Do NOT use the instance of this callback in `accept`
     - The view model is expected to hold on to an instance of this callback for the duration of its lifetime
     - This is considered a configuration step, and, therefore, is called before `first`
     - Messages sent on this channel are not filtered or debounced
