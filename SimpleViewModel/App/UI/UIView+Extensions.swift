     The following must be done for this to work:
       - The name of the xib must be the same name as the class
       - Set the File Owner's Custom Class property to the respective class
       - Leave the custom view Custom Class _empty_
       - Create outlets as usual. They should all be associated to the File Owner's

     Even though the constraints are set, the view itself (as well as the parent view), may require that the height of the view MUST be set. Especially when it is added to a `UIStackView` and the height is not yet known.
